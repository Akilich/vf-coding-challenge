# The-North-Face-Coding-Challenge
 
 Within this repo is a coding challenge for VF assesment/The North Face. Due to the potential team I would be joining not using a more complex framework, I chose to stick with what I would be using on the team (i.e.: vanilla HTML and vanilla CSS). If you would like to see this created with Vue, please let me know.
